# Motor Vehicle Crashes in NYC: Brief Overview
This dataset contains information about all the motor vehicle collisions that occurred in New York City from 2013-2022 reported by NYPD. It is required of the police department to report these collisions only if there is an injury, fatality, or a minimum of $1,000 in damage.

# Why Analyze this Dataset?
By analyzing the dataset and defining the problems it presents, we can help improve public safety by reducing the number of collisions on the road.

It is important to identify trends and patterns in the occurrence of motor vehicle collisions, understand the underlying causes of these collisions, and develop interventions to prevent them. The data can help us identify high-risk areas, specific factors contributing to collisions, and types of vehicles involved.

Additionally, the injury and fatality data can give us a clear understanding of the severity of collisions and their impact on public health and safety. By defining these problems, policymakers, transportation agencies, and community leaders can develop targeted strategies to improve road safety, reduce the number of collisions, and save lives.
